                    it might be needed for us to deliver to you our products, services and websites (collectively, our “Services”).
                    Your personal data includes information such as:</p>

                    personal data that we process.</p>
                <p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach us by
                    contacting us <a href="https://discord.connectedhost.xyz/" target="_blank">here</a>. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can provide

                <p>We collect information to provide the best possible experience when you use our Services. Much of what you
                    consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an account or purchase any of our Services (e.g. billing information, including name, address, and
                        credit card number).</li>
                    <li>Request assistance from our Customer Services team (e.g. telephone number).</li>
                    <li>Complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (e.g. email courses, e-books, or
                        emails).</li>
                    <li>Participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that
                        might require information about you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and
                    optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious, so we wanted to explain what these might
                    be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:</p>
                <p><strong>Account related information</strong> is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as
                    account number, products you have purchased, when products renew or expire, information requests, support
                    requests, and notes or details on our interactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> on our websites allow us to track your browsing behavior, links
                    clicked, items purchased, and your device types. They also allow us to collect data (including analytics) about
                    how you use and interact with our Services. This allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings,
                    a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyse, and improve the performance
                    of our Services. We may also collect your location via Internet Protocol (IP) address, so that we can
                    personalize our Services.</p>
                <p><strong>Data about Usage of Services</strong> is automatically collected when you use and interact with our
                    Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, and location information. This information includes
                    specific data about your interactions with the features, content, and links (including third-parties, such as
                    social media plugins) contained within the Services, IP address, browser type and settings (including
                    configuration and plug-ins), the date and time the Services were used, language preferences and cookie data, and
                    information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used,
                    device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and error data. Some of this data collected might
                    be capable of and be used to approximate your location.</p>
                <p><strong>Supplemented Data</strong> may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available
                    databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with
                    information we already have about you so that we can update, expand, and analyse the accuracy of our records,
                    identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us
                    personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for
                    the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>
                <h2 id="how-we-use-information">How we use information</h2>
                <p>We strongly believe in both reducing the amount of data we collect and limiting the use and purpose of that data
                    to only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data for which we have been given permission</li>
                    <li>Data necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with</li>
                    <li>Data we might be required or permitted to keep for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We utilise this information to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve and optimise the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile
                        applications)</li>
                    <li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</li>
                    <li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>
                    <li>Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services</li>
                    <li>Understand and analyse how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Often, much of the data we collect is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and
                    is not linked to any personal data. But as it is itself personal data, or it can be linked or linkable to
                    personal data, we treat it accordingly.</p>

                <p>We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with

                    third-party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:</p>
