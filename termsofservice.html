                    our archives / restoring a website or database to an earlier version. We

                <h3 id="10-script-usage-terms">10. SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</h3>
                <p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and
                    not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to
                    generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of
                    activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate
                    the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure
                    the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they
                    are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are
                    therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy
                    services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>
                <p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts
                    that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update
                    a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform
                    processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing
                    mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a
                    ConnectedHost-hosted domain.</p>
                <p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server
                    resources, or other sites on the same server</p>
                <p>Examples of not allowed script and website types include (but are not
                    limited to):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pornographic/adult content</li>

                    protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia
                    content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to
