                    any information, data or material in violation of any United States Federal, State or City law is prohibited. This
                    includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, material we judge to be threatening or obscene, or material
                    protected by trade secret and other statutes. The subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold harmless ConnectedHost and
                    its employees from any claims resulting from the use of the service which damages the subscriber or any other party.
                    Our acceptable use policy is actively and strictly enforced. Offending content or users are suspended from our
                    network, usually as soon as they are discovered, although we will always inform you when and why any action has been
                    taken. Pornography is prohibited on all ConnectedHost servers. This includes sites that include sexually explicit or
                    hardcore images and/or advertising.

                    Subscriber acknowledges that the service provided is of such a nature that service can be interrupted for many
                    reasons other than the negligence of the company and that damages resulting from any interruption of service are
                    difficult to ascertain. Therefore, subscriber agrees that the company shall not be liable for any damages arising
                    from such causes beyond the direct and exclusive control of the company.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Subscriber further acknowledges that the company's liability for its own negligence may not, in any event, exceed an
                    amount equivalent to charges payable by subscriber for services during the period damages occurred. In no event
                    shall the company be liable for any special or consequential damages, loss or injury.
